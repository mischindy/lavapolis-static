#### Instructions for the Debate Game 

FRIDAY IN VENICE / Lavapolis is a transmedia storytelling project and an online debate game about the future of Europe. People from all over Europe and the world will discuss critical social and political issues with Friday and develop alternative narratives for the continent. Friday will present debate prompts based on his experience traveling through Europe. Registered users can join the debate, read the opinions of others, and write and support proposals. Users who propose the most popular ideas will win privileges in the game (see Privileges).

#### Users

You can become a user by creating an account and logging in. Only registered users can fully participate in the debate game. Registered users can participate by supporting or opposing a proposal, adding comments, or writing their own proposals responding to the debate prompt.

#### Proposals

There are two types of proposals: official proposals and user community proposals. 

#### Official proposals (left column)

The moderator will open the debate by posting a debate prompt and a number of official proposals, which he or she has either written (highlighted in black) or borrowed from other sources. Official proposals are shown in the left column of the page. The proposals are ranked from top to bottom by popularity, so the proposal with the most support will be positioned at the top of the column.

#### Community proposals (right column)

Registered users can submit community proposals to compete with official proposals and other user proposals. Community proposals are shown in the right column of the page. Once logged in, registered users can submit proposals and provide supporting material in the form of images or videoslinks. 

#### Rating user proposals

Registered users are welcome to rate community proposals by clicking the green or red arrow to the left of the proposal. The numbers  next to the positive and negative signs reflect how often the user proposal has been supported (receiving positive points) and opposed (receiving negative points).

#### Nomination of usercommunity proposals

User proposals have to go through a nomination process in order to become official proposals. This process consists of acquiring support points from other users. A user can nominate a proposal in the right-hand column by clicking the check button to the upper left of the proposal.  A ring around the buttons measures how far away the community proposal is from being becoming an official proposal.
When the circle is complete it becomes an official proposal and moves from the right-hand column to the left-hand column, where it appears alongside the moderator’s proposals. The threshold is calculated as a value relative to the popularity (or lack thereof) of the official proposals.

#### Supporting official proposals

You can support an official proposal by clicking the check button to the upper left of the proposal. Displayed below the check button is the amount of support that the proposal has received; support is measured by the number of users that have clicked its check button. 

#### Commenting

Registered users can comment on both official and user proposals by clicking the comment link displayed directly below the proposal. Registered users can also support or oppose comments by clicking the green or red arrow, respectively.  

#### Duration of debate

Each debate will go on for a certain amount of time. In the upper right-hand corner of the page, a number will show how many days are left until the debate ends. You can only participate in a debate while it is active. Closed debates will be archived on the home page, where visitors are able to access them. 

#### Privileges

The three official proposals with the highest rating in a debate (not including proposals by the moderator) will be presented by the moderator in the section "Conclusion". In the following debate, their authors will be given the privilege of being able to bypass the nomination process required of user proposals; they will instead be able to directly submit official proposals. Repeat winners will be invited to propose their own debate topics to be hosted by the moderator.

#### Moderation

Registered users are able to post comments and user proposals directly on the website without moderation. However, we ask that all users behave respectfully toward one another. Inappropriate content will be removed from the forum and abusive users may be banned from participating in the debates.
