For centuries, islands and remote places have inspired people to ponder the question: are there possible societies other than the one we live in? Oscar Wilde once wrote: “A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing.” I couldn’t agree more! If we look closely enough, we can even see some small utopias in the real world: there are several hundred “micronations” out there, territories that claim sovereignty, but aren’t recognized by authorities abroad. Some are bizarre one-man kingdoms; others are communes with a clear idea of how to live the good life. Micronations teach us that utopias are still possible; we just need some imagination! This makes me wonder: if you could create a society from scratch, what basic rules would you create differently from those of our world? Join my debate now!
