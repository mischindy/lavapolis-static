was a guest of the Alfred Herrhausen Society in Berlin; they had invited important intellectual and political figures to participate in their conference, “Europe: Dream and Reality.” Friday was an onlooker, however. What he found particularly relevant was a critical review of what, if anything, Europeans have in common. 

Friday therefore launched his next debate right after the Herrhausen conference by asking his community to share with him their views on shared European values.

The discussion that followed showed that this subject is not at all boring. 
There was a neck-and-neck race between two other suggestions. User _Schilling_ suggested that skepticism towards European populism is well-founded:

“One of the values that Europeans should have learned from the time of dictatorship and fascism is to be sceptical about their governments. Even though you might agree with their politics at times you should never trust them, you should never let them influence you to the point where you lose your principles and own will. Regarding the rise of nationalistic and racist parties in many European countries, skepticism is again extremely important. You should never blindly follow the rhetoric of the powerful.”

Schilling’s proposal won finally 5 points and got the first place in the debate.


In a sober statement, user sandoz reminded us that we shouldn’t take today’s peace in Europe for granted. Here is the statement:
“We share a long period of peace. This is extraordinary looking at other continents. However, this peace needs to be protected. Some say Europe has to become better prepared to defend itself. Ukraine shows how fragile peace can be and how close war.”
Sandoz’s proposal got the second highest ranking  and was nominated as an official proposal. 

Aphta, a close runner-up, proposed that pop culture is one of Europe’s core values; the proposal took third in the debate.
Here is the argument: “Europe always wants to be something particular. But it is the result of a war disaster and the intervention of two larger powers, Soviet Russia and the US. Today, Europe is mostly the product of Western market economy and Pop Culture. Pop Culture is nothing specifically European. It is Western. What Europe shares with the rest of the Western world might be its most important value: the value of POP!”
Further details of the debate can be found in the archive.

#### Congratulation to Schilling, sandoz and aphta! Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and immediately join the official list of proposals. Don’t forget: repeat winners earn the privilege of proposing a subject for debate to Friday!

#### We wish all participants even more success in the next rounds.
