Francesca, Piero, and Lorenzo belong to an activist group called Poveglia Per Tutti. Poveglia is an abandoned island in the Venetian Lagoon and “Tutti” are around 4,000 members who support the idea of reoccupying Poveglia. The island has a long history, in which Romans, Napoleon, and even a giraffe play a part. It was also home to a quarantine station and, later, an orphanage run by a mad director. Today, the former orphanage is a ruin engulfed by a wild forest. The island is allegedly the most haunted in Europe. Francesca, Piero, and Lorenzo assure me that there are no ghosts on Poveglia; it is Italian economic policy that’s haunted, they say. The Venetian government is trying to auction off the lease for Poveglia. But the activists believe that, if privatized, the island will become just another tourist resort. They’d rather use it to create a new common ground. To reinhabit it. To start life on Poveglia from scratch. Sounds like my home island of Lavapolis. So I have invited Francesca, Piero, and Lorenzo to participate in “Friday in Venice.”
