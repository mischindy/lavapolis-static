On a highway in Slovakia, a car with a Ukrainian license plate had broken down. In the heat of late afternoon, smoke whirled from the hood of what looked like a twenty-year-old van. Two guys fumbled around in the engine with their bare hands. Both were tall and with their placid looks they reminded me of Orthodox monks. In a field next to the road, a lady gazed towards the horizon. She wore a brimmed hat and a wide, white shirt. Her face was half covered by big octagon-shaped sunglasses. Her name was Olga. She was on her way to an art exhibition. The car was packed with a massive metal ring and a square frame holding big pieces of charcoal. “This black square is a present from Kazimir Malevich,” she explained to me. “Malevich predicted that modernity would bring us civilization and happiness. Modernity has arrived. Now we are waiting for happiness.” The two guys fixed the engine. Before they left, she opened the window and called out: “Think of a world and live in it!”
