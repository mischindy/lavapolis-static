5 official proposals, 6 community proposals

A few weeks from now, the Scots will decide, in a referendum, if they want to remain part of the United Kingdom. If they vote for independence, Britain will not be so great any more. An alliance that lasted for centuries is at stake. Catalonia, too, is planning a non-binding referendum on November 9 on whether or not to secede from Spain. There are other secessionist movements going on in Europe, in regions like Flanders in Belgium and the Veneto in Italy, where a few months ago 80 percent of the population voted to become independent. The referendum was unofficial, but it shows the discontent many people feel about their national identity. Experts speak about **nations without a state** and forecast that even more independence movements will crop up throughout Europe. In the midst of a financial and economic crisis, what these independence movements show is that the continent also has to face cultural challenges that are not necessarily related to the economic climate.

Knowing the long and often painful history between particular regions and European governments, I asked our community and myself the following question:

**Is the end of the European nation-state about to come??**

We received around sixty contributions. Not so bad for a debate that doesn’t touch on the hard facts of fiscal stability or youth unemployment. And it showed that our users, despite not sharing one point of view, share a common concern: if Europe were to splinter into smaller entities, it would return to a labyrinth of mini-states and the endless borders that Europe has been lucky to overcome since the end of the Cold War and in the process of international integration.

User _Serge_ made it to the top of the list with five nomination votes. This proposal does not suggest a specific scenario but instead proposes a surprising strategy to overcome the paralysis in the engineering of a common sense of European-ness:

Reality is not everything
_Serge_     nominated 16 days ago
Europe needs its own Dream Factory. A dream tank instead of the many think tanks, with public recognition allowing a diversion from the current realpolitik. Realpolitik is haunting as it tells you that there is no other possibility but the current mess. Genuine dreamers have to be appointed. The results of the Dream Factory have to be acknowledged by governments, business leaders, and media.

User _sirius_ presented a political scenario that shows the absurdity of the political condition of 19th century Europe. His statement came in second after _Serge’s_.

Well, imagine
_sirius_     nominated a day ago
Europe returning to the 19th century. It would be a nightmare: borders again, local currencies, petty bourgeoisie everywhere, Front National everywhere. It would be like Germany 150 years ago. A conglomerate of ridiculously small entities with no visibility, no power whatsoever. Maybe there are good reasons for people's frustration with their central governments. But again, what happened with Germany after it was unified in 1871? It became a wild beast of economic power, hunger for territories and resources and political ambition which crashed everything into the disasters of the 20th century. Want a repetition? Then vote for Scotland’s independence et al!

_Noisy_ elaborated on the impact of globalization on the current secessionist movements. This proposal came in third in the debate:

Who are we?
_noisy_      13 days ago 3 replies
There is a big identity crisis going on in some countries. Britons ask themselves if the Scots or the Europeans or the Americans don't love them anymore because of their inconsistent behavior, the French see their postwar social system finally going down the drain, Italy wakes up from the Berlusconi coma and realizes that it is a conglomerate of regions with a dramatic social divide. With so much of insecurity about who we are, there is no wonder about movements trying to depart from the common ground. The confusion has a name: globalization.


**Check out the archive to read the debate in full.**

**Congratulation to _Serge_, _sirius_ and _noisy_! Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and will instead immediately be considered as official proposals.**

**Don’t forget: repeat winners can earn the privilege of proposing a subject for debate to me!
I wish all participants even more success in the next rounds.**
