The sun almost never sets in Moscow during the summer. It is now past 11 PM. Seryosha and I are near Bolotnaya Square. Here, protesters once clashed with the police over the re-election of Putin. Seryosha was one of them. The police arrested him three times. He used to say: I’ll be available again three days after the next demonstration—arrests don’t last longer than 48 hours. But this seems like a long time ago now. Seryosha points to the Moskva River and the church where Pussy Riot held their concert. We are sitting down. The tin roof is still warm. Seryosha likes to stroll on the roofs of his hometown. Sometimes he brings his friends along. Today I get to see this monstrous city from above. The darker it gets, the more lights appear in the twilight. Every Russian wants to live here, says Seryosha. Everyone from the former USSR. They come from Ukraine, Tajikistan, or Armenia. Mostly illegals. In millions. Nobody knows how many millions live here. This is the dark city of the dazed and confused.
