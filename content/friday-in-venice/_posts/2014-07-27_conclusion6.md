6 official proposals, 4 community proposals

Experts on demographics have warned many Western countries about the consequences of their shrinking, ageing populations for quite some time now. Some have drawn a gloomy picture of the future of national populations and countries like Italy or Japan.

This provoked me to ask the following question:

Is an ageing Society the End?
In countries like Germany, Italy, and Spain, the population is declining by as much as 30 to 40 percent. With not enough new people being born to replace those that are ageing, these countries rely on immigrants to work and sustain the tax base. But immigration is no panacea. Germany alone would need 300 million new immigrants over the next hundred years to counterbalance this demographic trend. So are there any solutions?
 
Responding to this question, the community was in strong disagreement over the importance of preserving national populations. Some expect that the world will homogenize over the long-term; others highlight the need to preserve distinctive differences between people. However, most respondents accept that changes in social values have caused the ageing and shrinkage of Europe.  

Perhaps unsurprisingly, user _magy’s_ call for higher level of “re-productivity” won the top spot in the debate:

Babies

As simple is that. Never thought about it...? Seems people have forgotten how to make them. And for what purpose. In my eyes this is something schools should work on. Seriously. It’s more important than IT and history combined.
The comments to this proposal and others showed a strong opinion that consideration for the upcoming generations has to be fostered and even taught at school.

A user with the rather Chinese-sounding name _xinhua_ suggested that national populations will go extinct over the course of the coming centuries and will instead be replaced by world citizens. This proposal came second in the debate: 

The end of nations and the beginning of mankind
_xinhua_     nominated 10 days ago
In 200 years there might be no Germans, Spaniards etc anymore but residents of Germany, Spain etc. Whoever will populate the territory they will live there and hopefully love it...

User _sirius_ went even further down the same road and pointed specifically to the anticipated Asian immigration to Europe. This proposal touches on some thorny issues in the field of European migration policy. In the past, immigrants in Europe have often been considered socially inferior and therefore an additional burden to the welfare system. With highly competitive, talented people from emerging countries entering the European labour market, this perspective has changed. _Sirius’_ proposal ranked third on the list of community proposals:

There is never an end
_sirius_     nominated 19 hours ago
China has brought goods and brings now people. As these people are usually hard working they will create also in Europe (as elsewhere) a higher GDP. In some countries they do so already but as part of a shadow economy. Instead of marginalising them Europe should embrace this influx as part of its rejuvenation.

The community showed little concern about preserving national populations and their cultures. This does not fully reflect what’s currently common sense among the public. Instead, the rise of nationalism, localism, and xenophobia shows that there is no consensus in Europe on how to address both population decline and the pressure to absorb more immigrants.

**Congratulation to _magy_, _Xinhua_ and _sirius_! Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and will instead immediately be considered as official proposals.**

**Don’t forget: repeat winners can earn the privilege of proposing a subject for debate to me!
I wish all participants even more success in the next rounds.**
