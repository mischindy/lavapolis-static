5 official proposals, 4 community proposals

I came across plenty of skepticism about the future of the EU while traveling through the continent. Except for a few encounters with people who openly supported a “United States of Europe,” I mostly heard that the idea of the EU was pathetic. In particular, I sensed resentment between Northern European nations and those on the Mediterranean, going back to the crisis in Greece. The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben expressed his concerns about a dominating German influence in Europe in a Libération interview last December. Following the postwar thinking of his French colleague Alexandre Kojeve, who at the time was a bureaucrat in the government of De Gaulle, Agamben revived the idea of a “Latin Empire” to tip the balance of power away from Germany. The problem, he stated, was not so much economic but about cultural differences. A Greek shouldn’t be forced to become a German.

In light of this, I asked the community the following question:

**Should Southern Europe form a "Latin Empire"?**

It prompted around sixty proposals and comments and became one of the most popular debates so far. The contributions were always fair, while also being controversial. Pro and cons for and against a greater or lesser “Latin” identity were discussed and evaluated. An entertaining form of cultural irony sometimes undermined appreciation for either a Latin or Germanic way of life. 

User _Serge_ finally won the debate. Here is the proposal:

**Latin is sexy**

Agamben has revived the idea of Kojeve, who was a French post-war civil servant and philosophical institution, at the same time warning De Gaulle over a rise of Germany and a potential marginalization of France when Germany allies with the Anglo-Saxons. The latter did not really happen but the marginalization takes place now. I like to see thinkers and artists in defense of the Latin way of life. It might be less efficient and confusing. But while Silicon Valley is trying to convince the whole world of the need to network and optimize life the Latin culture remains resistant. It is less predictable and still full of surprise. In cultural terms it is an empire. It will always be.

 
This argument for a diverse Europe, with a perhaps less efficient and more creative “Latin” force, moved, almost undisputed, to the top of the list of proposals.

It was followed by user _samson’s_ proposal, which asked for a differentiation between France and Italy and questioned the notion of a coherent “Latin” identity. 

**No clash of cultures**

_samson_     nominated a day ago

Agamben plays the ventriloquist for the French here. Italians probably wouldn't mind becoming a bit more Germanic. Plenty of them have lived in Germany for generations and seem to be happy. Besides, Dutch and Germans long for the Mediterranean. Yes, there are differences. But the North and the South, the Protestant and the Catholic have already created a mix which doesn't allow a new separation.

While samson disagreed with the term “Latin,” user _aphta_ questioned Agamben’s idea of an empire. This statement was also officially nominated and became the third most popular proposal. 

Instead of empires, _aphta_ argued, the Europe of today needs to be understood as a network. And the more it operates this way, the stronger it will become. Everything else, to _aphta_, is provincialism.

**Empire?**
aphta     nominated 10 days ago

The concept of empire is outdated. Today (and in the future) networked politics is what matters. The entity is as strong as its network of relations to other entities. So Europe will be as strong as its network between regions and states and people, of course. Countries need to provide even more exchange across the borders. But we observe the opposite. Also in media: 
Less and less international stuff, more local. Self-centered communication supports self-centered politics. Provincialism.

**Congratulation to _Serge_, _samson_ and _aphta_! Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and will instead immediately be considered as official proposals.**

**Don’t forget: repeat winners can earn the privilege of proposing a subject for debate to me!
I wish all participants even more success in the next rounds.**
