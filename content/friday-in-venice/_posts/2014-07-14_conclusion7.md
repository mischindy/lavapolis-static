5 Official Proposals, 3 Community Proposals

Despite years of policy initiatives and social engagement, Europe is far from gender equality. Surveys show that women are still paid less than their male counterparts. They also receive less recognition for their work and social roles, and have less influence in politics, academics, and business, despite often working harder than men. Moreover, social tensions often result in an increase in violence toward women.

Moreover, social tensions often result in an increase in violence toward women. While traveling through different European countries, talking to people and observing their customs, I saw the frustration that many people—not only women—feel toward this situation. I therefore raised the following question: 

Is Europe really modern?

My argument: Violence against women does not correspond with our image of an enlightened Europe. But the message behind the numbers of a recent study is clear: one in three European women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence―if we take into consideration the entire 18-to-74-year-old population of the EU, this adds up to 61.3 million women. How, in light of this statistic, can society portray itself as enlightened and modern? Does the violence against women point to more deep-seated problems in European societies? Can we say that feminism has reached its goals when we live in a world where outmoded gender norms are still part of the everyday life?

The conversation that followed was less controversial than in previous debates, but there was some disagreement within the community about the extent to which both genders can tackle the problem. The role of feminism was also debated.
Two community proposals were officially nominated through votes cast by the community. User _Elisa_ proposed that governments provide more educational anti-violence programs at not only schools, but also in the workplace. 

More More Control
_Elisa_     nominated 3 days ago
Politics should increasingly turn its attention to the violence theme. A medical survey routine finding issue of violence should be developed. Employers and unions should consider performing training for personnel managers, so that cases of abuse can be discovered. In addition, sexual offenses should be punished more severely. Anti-violence training should be held regularly in schools and kindergartens.

This proposal ranked highest among community proposals and took the first place in the debate. It was followed by a more polemical statement from user noisy that called for feminists to engage less agresssively in the discussion:  

Less defensive
_noisy_     nominated 12 days ago
Female empowerment is weak because it is often defensive. Yes, women are treated badly. But feminism struggles to become accepted across the board. Why? It's too edgy. Many women want to be part of mainstream not of a revolution. Women need womenism instead of feminism as a strong advocacy.

The proposal for a “mainstream” approach to the problem challenged the role of feminism and came in second.
While a proposal to ban pornography found little sympathy among users, totalpeace considered the relevance of cultural and religious boundaries to the discussion and found some support from the community. 

Look across national borders
_totalpeace_     17 days ago 0 replies
There is no general panacea to violence against women. Despite the notion that it exists everywhere there are big differences between countries. Take (Post)Berlusconi Italy and compare to Scandinavia. The social condition of women is still very much bound to national, cultural, and religious conditions. Mediterranean countries may not be able to import all positive changes having been achieved elsewhere but should seriously consider them.

Although conditions for women do indeed vary significantly between different countries, the proposal did not get the points required for a nomination and therefore remained on the side of the community proposals.

**Congratulation to _Elisa_ and _noisy_! Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and will instead immediately be considered as official proposals.**

**Don’t forget: repeat winners can earn the privilege of proposing a subject for debate to me!
I wish all participants even more success in the next rounds.**
