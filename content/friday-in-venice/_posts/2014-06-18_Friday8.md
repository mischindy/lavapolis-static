He hit the road for twelve years, traveling between Scandinavia and the Mediterranean. It was fun, he said. He knew Spain by heart. He liked the sun and the sea, even through his windshield. He also liked being under the surveillance of the company’s dispatcher via satellite. The company was based in Denmark. The owner liked fishing and invited his drivers every Christmas for a nice dinner at his home. In Denmark, they made €3 more per hour than in Germany.

A year later, the company went to the wall. He became a taxi driver in Hamburg and met his former boss again. The boss was devastated over his loss of the company. He said: today, people study business and think that they’ll make in three years what we made in thirty.
