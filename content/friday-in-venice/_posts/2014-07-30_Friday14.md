Elio is a gardener; his shop is in a village that's right by a checkpoint between Lugano and Varese, in the small, lovely Swiss canton of Ticino. I met Elio during dinner in a little joint set in a vineyard. It was hard to live here up until the '50s, he said. There was almost no work. Chestnuts were the only food available. Still, his father commuted hundreds of kilometers for work. Since then,Ticine has become rich, especially with the boom in the '70s. Elio's employees come from Italy. Every morning, there is a queue on the other side of the border of laborers entering Switzerland. In the afternoon, the traffic moves in the opposite direction. “For many generations, it was we Swiss crossing the border for work,” Elio said. Now the tables have turned. Some look down on the Italians. “They have forgotten where we came from, and complain about the 'flood' of commuters 'blocking' the roads. But just imagine if the stopped. Our wealth would stop, too,” said Elio.
