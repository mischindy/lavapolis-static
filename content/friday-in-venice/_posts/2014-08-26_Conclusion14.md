5 Official and 6 community proposals

I met with many people of my generation during my trip through Europe. One of their major concerns was future job prospects. Some say they are given a decent education, but no opportunities to apply it. Other criticise both the current education system and the labour market. With up to 50 percent of the younger generation out of work in some countries, the situation is grave. One woman in France told me that she feels as if her generation is the forgotten one, as her parents enjoyed so many more opportunities to work and develop careers.
This is why I tried to raise this subject:

The European Union promised to develop a flexible, secure labour market with nearly endless opportunities for foreign workers. But, to me, the international creation of a welcoming culture seems to be in its early stages when we consider the social and administrative barriers workers must face. EU states already face a shortage of skilled labour and, simultaneously, an influx of qualified workers, but to my mind the politicians still don’t know how to react to it. Can we say that the term “from rags to riches” has been reversed?

Given the nature of the debate, I felt there was a certain scepticism among users of the community. Despite some interesting proposals, it seemed difficult for some participants to imagine a labour market with better opportunities. There is a dilemma between wanting to embrace multiculturalism and globalisation on the one hand, and wanting to be protected from the competition of the free market.

However, there were very interesting proposals. Maybe they will be heard by politicians and considered by decision makers.

User _Xinhua_, one of our most active and successful contributors, compared his proposal with the way that Europe tries to encourage cultural engagement in cities:

**European Capital of Labour Innovation**

The Labour Capital Project: Similar to the project of European Capitals for Culture, cities are chosen to present a new concept of how to create job opportunities and employment for European citizens

This idea was positively received and became the highest ranked proposal.Somebody proposed Naples as the first capital for the project.

Interestingly, the second most popular proposal also dealt with the concept of awards. User _rabbit_, however, looked rather at the potential for public-private partnerships to strengthen pan-European labour practices: 

**I am missing**

An award for best practise in integrating international employees in a company!

There were many critical posts by disillusioned job seekers, and I wanted to give them, too, a voice in one of my proposals. The community voted otherwise, however. User paglio’s optimistic proposal took third place. How well it reflects the overall mood among young Europeans remains to be seen:

**Competitiveness**

There is a lot of competition between countries, regions, cities and institutions about heritage recognition. Why? It attracts tourists and makes money. The whole distinction between public and private is pathetic. Governments behave no differently from travel agencies when it comes to monument marketing. They claim to apply for protection and preservation and once they get recognition (for example from the UNESCO World Heritage program) they do everything possible to get people to the site, cash in, and endanger the monument even further!

**Congratulation to _Xinhua_, _rabbit_, and _paglio_!
