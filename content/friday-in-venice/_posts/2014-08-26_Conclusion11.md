I was glad to see that our users have become more daring in their proposals!
In the final leg of my European travels, I travelled through the South. In the eyes of many Europeans, this region is particularly vulnerable right now. I have tried to understand, in conversation with people in Italy and Greece, some of the most pressing issues; others I followed in the media. As such, I decided to talk about these socially critical points.

Given the fact that, almost every day, I read about new incidents involving illegal immigration from Africa to the Mediterranean coast, I have asked the following question that I was confronted with many times during my trip:

**How can we control migration across the Mediterranean?**

It became an intense debate with around eighty contributions, which were sometimes pessimistic and often controversial. It is clear that there are many opinions, but no straightforward solutions. Does this excuse the EU for failing to address the matter? I don’t think so. When Jean Claude Juncker, the President-elect of the European Commission, announced in his inaugural speech that the problem is a European one, some of our users wondered whether the defensive actions proposed by Juncker would result in better conditions for both the immigrants and the local population in southern Italy.

_Serge_, an active user who had successfully participated in earlier discussions, won the debate’s contest with four nominations. Here’s his proposal:

**Immigration Lab**

Why not turn Lampedusa in an immigration laboratory? You could even think of an artificial island temporarily built by the EU for exploring new ways of social development where we undo the existing immigration principles and invent others more suitable for our time and condition?

This idea may be of particular interest to visitors to the Venice Architecture Biennale, which I recently attended. Serge has become known in our online community for his proposal of a dream factory. At face value, his idea to transform Lampedusa into a lab for immigration seems very utopian. But can things change without utopian ideas?

User _gim_ came second after Serge with his proposal that European countries should learn from Switzerland’s migration policy:  

**Swiss Example**

Consider the Swiss referendum, which established annual quotas for foreigners employed in the Swiss territory to help the Swiss economy, and gives preference to Swiss citizens. Following this example, Europe would decrease the possibility of access for migrants and would have a drastic reduction of work permits.

Despite a lot of headwind from critics, this proposal became pretty popular. Is Switzerland’s controversial referendum a sign that the European mainstream wants to close the continent’s borders and reimagine Europe as a fortress? There are obviously many people—including members of our online community—who believe so.

Several proposals touched on the critical geopolitical condition of the Mediterranean and the ongoing malaise around the social and economic changes brought on by globalisation. However, _otto6_ had a different, more optimistic perspective on the issue. Here his proposal:

**African immigrants successors of our ancestors**

_otto6_ 16 days ago 1 replies

Many of our great-grandparents went to America. They had to go through terrible conditions to get there. Some were smuggled, died from hunger, drowned, suffocated. Like the immigrants in the Mediterranean today. The survivors among our ancestors contributed to the rise of America. Why shouldn't immigrants to Europe today do the same to their new home?

I found this an intriguing comparison. Not only between Europe and the United States in the past, but also between Europe and Africa today. Certainly worth considering… _Otto6_ took third place in the competition.

**Congratulation to _Serge_, _gim_ and _otto6_!Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and will instead immediately be considered as official proposals.**

**Don’t forget: repeat winners can earn the privilege of proposing a subject for debate to me!
I wish all participants even more success in the next rounds.**
