7 official proposals, 2 community proposals

Elections across Europe brought to the forefront a growing discomfort on the part of many Europeans with the continent’s current state of democracy. Many people either didn’t vote at all or supported anti-establishment movements. At the same time, the goals of these movements are often short-lived. As a result, national politics is paralyzed while social unrest is increasing, like in Italy.
So is the European democratic system on the verge of failing? Is there a need to rethink or even replace it?

Here again is my debate prompt:

Singapore as a Role Model for Europe?

Democratic elites have failed to foster voters’ confidence in representative democracy. More and more people tend to admire autocratic systems, like Singapore or Qatar. Both the left (Gerhard Schroeder) and the right (Silvio Berlusconi) have praised politicians like Putin, calling them “great operators.” The desire for social safety and economic growth undercuts the potential of democratic choice. Should Europe adopt a system like that of China and Dubai?

My proposals: 
- Democratic systems have to become more bottom up
- Democracy needs to be replaced by models like the “Guardian State” one of countries like Singapore or the United Arab Emirates.
- It is primarily not a political problem, but a problem of governance. Governments should be run like corporations.
 
The respondents quickly divided into two camps with contrasting opinions on the need for democracy. While a majority of debaters proposed enhancing the European (Western) model of universal democracy, a number of people challenged the system. 

The debate’s results reveal a more complex picture. Lalo Martins achieved the highest ranking with his proposal to divide the responsibility of governing between governments and corporations. The corporations would ensure greater efficiency in political administration while the government would act as a “watchdog” supervising the governance services provided by corporations. Even though the libertarian streak of this argument is somewhat unfamiliar in European political thinking, this proposal landed on top of the list of community proposals:
Logical next step for capitalism

We need a model that will adapt to change without becoming bloated.

I'm not a very big fan of capitalism personally, but I think in the worst dystopian cyberpunk writings, a possible solution might actually be hidden.

I'd suggest we scale back government as a concept, so that its *only* role is a watchdog for corporations, ensuring they're playing by the rules and putting the common good first. Essentially, only the accountability mechanisms.

Then leave everything else to corporations. This way, new entrants who bring radical new solutions will have their fair chance; if the big, bloated, corrupt megacorps don't have a lawmaking body to lobby and corrupt, they'll actually find their power limited rather than increased. While the ones that are big, but not (yet?) rotten will have their customary advantages, which is fine because the majority prefers to go with the safe route. Then the curves of tech advancement would (ideally) start appearing in all other areas.

User _blabla_ defended the European model, but also acknowledged reluctance among Europeans to accept competition between social models, something that’s integral to globalization. He called for more confidence in European democracy in order to attract fresh talent from developing countries: 

No

But it should openly compete with those authoritarian concepts. The more Europe pulls out of the global competition on soft power, the more other systems will prevail on the planet. I am sure people in China would be happy to live in France or even Italy if they could (many of them do already). See this pic. Beijing is not at all a desirable alternative. The Chinese Dream a fake.

_Otto6_ came in third in the debate and his proposal—that a Protestant culture is a way of making a society work more efficiently—made it onto the list of official proposals. Referring to Max Weber’s hypothesis that Protestantism drove capitalism, this idea points to the conflict between the way in which Northern and Mediterranean countries have handled the financial crisis; the suggestion is that the “Northern” way is perhaps a better option for all:
 
Europe needs to become Protestant
_otto6_     nominated 6 hours ago

This gentleman, German economist Max Weber, found out some 90 years ago how much protestantism has contributed to shaping capitalism. Looking at the world of today Europe is much better of in protestant than in catholic countries. Economically speaking Europe needs to absorb protestantism. This is: austerity, hard working ethics. Read Weber and you understand what is missing in the Mediterranean...

This proposal and some others met strong opposition, but also garnered many positive points. The ongoing, constructive mistrust of capitalism today by thinkers like Thomas Piketty makes evident that the rules of social justice need to be rewritten.

**Congratulation to _Lalo Martins_, _blabla_ and _otto6_! Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and will instead immediately be considered as official proposals.**

**Don’t forget: repeat winners can earn the privilege of proposing a subject for debate to me!
I wish all participants even more success in the next rounds.**
