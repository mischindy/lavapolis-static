4 official proposals, 14 community proposals

We have never before received so many proposals. Clearly, the imagination about a (better) world that does not (yet) exist is not at all exhausted! Coming from Lavapolis, I’m glad that I’m able to make this observation. Why?

Because the island’s residents are part of a social project, an ongoing political, economic, and cultural experiment that will facilitate continuously renewable ways of living. We call our island a heterotopia, a counter-site, that reveals the real world but also challenges it. During my travels through Europe, I have often thought to myself that the continent could use some kind of heterotopia. 
This is why I presented the following prompt to our online community:

Imagine an unpopulated island. There are no rules or regulations yet. Just you and a group of people and one big task: to make this new island society a better place than the world today. If you could start from scratch, what basic societal rules would you change?

_Lalo Martins_ received a lot of support with this proposal:

**No government. No corporations.**

_Lalo Martins_     nominated 8 days ago

Those interested in something – from creating a piece of software to providing water and energy and health to the general population to national defence to international relations – can group together in an organisation structured like a cooperative or foundation, the primary goal being fulfilling the charter objective and the primary metric being “customer” satisfaction.

Why would we need a formal government? We just need a system of arbitration for when there's conflict, and that can be something in the style of direct democracy (as described in the Wisdom of the Crowd proposal).
His suggestion received four nomination points and became the winner of this round.

The discussion reflected the fact that imagination doesn’t know any boundaries. Somebody proposed abolishing family education, while another person dreamt of a life in tents and caves. The argument that utopia is a form of self-deception did not find traction.

User _Xinhua_ came second after _Lalo Martins_ with his proposal:

**Imagine there are all religions...**

_xinhua_    11 days ago 1 replies

Strict rules for religion. No one prevails. All have to accept a code of tolerance. Basic human rights have to be accepted by everyone. No Islamic oppression in families.

This made me think of one of Lavapolis’ constitutional pillars: universal solidarity, which allows cultural and religious distinction only to the extent that it does not create any notion of superiority. In our country, this motto rules: what joins us comes before what divides us.

The third-most-successful proposal also reminded me of Lavapolis, where we enjoy a strong political emphasis on social empowerment: 

**Human Resource**

_autobahn_     20 days ago 1 replies

Job creation: The main resource of added value is the human being. The current way of destroying employment by rationalising without creating new jobs is devastating. Social services, culture, and education have to be understood as the main potentials for new job and value creation

_Autobahn’s_ proposal does not seem dreamy, but very realistic to me. Not only in a heterotopia, but also in Europe.

**Congratulation to _Lalo Martins_, _Xinhua_, and _autobahn_!**
