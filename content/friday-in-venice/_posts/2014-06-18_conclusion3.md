Not surprisingly, in some countries, like France, Britain, and Poland, far-right parties had a strong showing in the European Parliament election. In other countries,  like Greece, the far left advanced. Europe’s growing discontent with the political establishment bears down on the center of the political spectrum. Populist movements promise grass-roots engagement, while often obscuring their hidden agendas. The eloquence of rightists is more convincing to many people than the promises of Europe’s ruling politicians. As Martin Schulz, the former Social Democratic president of the European Parliament, put it: “Today, Anti-Europe has got a soul.”

What works in today’s political landscape? And what goes wrong? Friday’s third debate showed that there is little agreement among users in our online community. Many often contradicting comments demonstrated discontent with both the left and the right, as well as the center. But there was also constructive conversation. 

User _ntaj_ received the most votes for the following reflection:

“The "success" of the right wing is based on the ability to give simple answers - usually very wrong answers to very complex issues.

"Success" is a very very delicate word - in my opinion it doesn't match here. Firstly look at the turnout, at the participation in countries like France: 43%. The rest, 57% did not vote! They did not give their vote to the Front Nationale. So the Front Nationale is not representing the French population. It is rather profiting from being able to mobilize a part of the population with very simple polemics and rhetorics.
Left leaning people, especially intellectuals etc., on the other hand, can't be mobilized with simple answers. This is why the left communicates with very detailed, very complex arguments. And then the split arises - it is not that people don't understand their arguments, it's rather that they don't agree with the details! This would be the case as soon as any other party would be so clear about the details, too! But they aren't!
Many left leaning people therefore don't vote! They are reluctant to make compromises, they are looking for a party that represents them 100% - and this party does not exist. It will never exist.
The true dilemma is that the right has not won - but that we believe and that media makes us believe they won. In reality the silent mass is in the majority. And whether this mass will turn left or right is the core question at hand.”

In his statement, user _noisy_ completely rejects the current state of affairs and instead suggests a political position outside the party system:
“Take Tocqueville, Thoreau, Juenger, Fukuyama, Arendt: Isn't it often the conservative thinker with a longer-term outreach? I suggest that left intellectuals are usually more attached to zeitgeist as it goes. No wonder if their impact doesn't last for long. Political strategy needs resilience and some independence from the daily business. The Left is too much tactical.”

Both proposals made it onto the list of official proposals. _noisy_ had even more to say on this subject and pointed out, as an example of what contributed to the success of populist movements, the flamboyant and canny rhetoric of Nigel Farage from the right-wing UK Indepence Party. This entry received 66 percent of the votes it needed for a full nomination and took third place in the debate.

**Congratulation to _ntaj_ and _noisy_! Their proposals in the following debate will bypass the nomination process and will instead immediately be considered as official proposals. Don’t forget: repeat winners can earn the privilege to propose a subject for debate to Friday!**
