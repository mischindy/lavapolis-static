5 official proposals, 10 community proposals

This debate was another vibrant exchange on one of the other most pressing issues facing southern Europe today. With unemployment rates between 30 and more than 50 percent, the future looks very gloomy for the younger generation of Spaniards, Italians, and Greeks. No wonder that many of them have left their home countries. In Teulada, in the southern part of Sardinia, I met a taxi driver in his fifties who told me that he had lived near Duisburg in Germany for more than thirty years; he returned home only a few years ago. “Now,” he said, “the next generation is supposed to take the same route to get work.”

Here is my reflection on the problem:

University graduates and talented young people from Italy, Spain, and Greece are increasingly emigrating and moving to northern Europe, where national economies are stronger and more stable. The loss of creative, highly educated people, combined with the inability to attract qualified foreigners, hurts the countries of the South. How can we stop this brain drain?

Again, user _gim_ was among the winners of this competition. This time he got to the top of the list with three nomination points. Here is his proposal:

**Tax Breaks**

_gim_     nominated 19 days ago

Provide an incentive like Italy’s Controesodo law, which gives tax breaks to Italian citizens who, after having worked abroad for more than two years, have relocated to Italy and/or begun working for an Italian start-up.

This sounds like a very pragmatic solution. However, some were sceptical of this approach, because it seems to support people who personally benefit from going abroad but lack national loyalty. This did not prevent the proposal from coming in first place.

_Pinguin_ made a proposal that doesn’t sound alien to the practices of some European countries and, in particular, some corporations. His/her proposal came in second with two nomination points:

**Public/ Private**

Interestingly, throughout the debate, there was an underlying discussion about quality of life: Why do people prefer certain cities over others? What makes a place attractive? In this discussion, London became an example both of turbo capitalism and of a city with opportunities.

One of the sentiments that emerged strongly in the debate was that a younger generation of Europeans have benefited from the opening up of national borders. This generation no longer associates itself so much with national identities, but have enjoyed and benefited from a European educational system, which allows them freely to choose jobs across the continent.

User _doctor_ received a lot of support from parts of the community that feel this way:

**Erasmus Generation**

_doctor_    2 days ago 1 replies

There is only one Europe. The Erasmus program wanted to produce a generation of European natives. Many of them don't look at national labour markets anymore. They may come from Florence or Athens or Madrid and work in Berlin or London, and just feel like living and working somewhere on the continent.

_Doctor’s_ proposal took third place and confirmed that there are those among the younger Europeans who believe in a common identity and the potential of their generation.
