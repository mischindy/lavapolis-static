Michael grew up in a divided city: Nicosia, Cyprus. Two separate governments accused each other of being illegitimate.  A wall runs through the city. Under UN protection, Michael and his friends recorded the public face of both parts of Nicosia: its facades, graffiti, and posters. They collected objects from the past and the present. Assembled together, they created a kind of wallpaper that appeared throughout the city. An expression of political resentment and the country’s struggle over ideology. Many of the objects were glued on top of each other, often already decaying. The wallpaper became an open book about the history and the current developments in the Cypriot “Cold War.” Michael presented his piece in an exhibition. People started scratching the layers to reveal what was underneath. They discovered something tricky about walls: they not only divide people; they also connect them. They reflect hate and arrogance in both directions. And they mirror a dark and unfinished history.
