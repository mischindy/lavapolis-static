It’s soccer time! I can’t escape the World Cup. Even in so-called “global cities” like London you see a lot of cars with national flags fluttering from their windows. In a recent poll, Europeans were asked if how upset they’d be if the team of their home country were kicked out of the tournament. A third said, yes, they’d be upset. But it’s ONLY a third and it was sixty percent or so twenty years ago? In a bar near Leicester Square, I met a gay couple; both wore t-shirts of the Cameroon football team. It turned out they were English, though. In the same bar, and in similar joints that I frequented during my trip through Paris and Amsterdam, I saw people watching, cheering, and yammering on about games, even when their country wasn’t playing. Seems football isn’t so much about national pride, after all. Maybe there is a growing number of fans who just love football.
