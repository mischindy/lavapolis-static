5 official proposals, 8 community proposals

Perhaps it’s not surprising that this debate became particularly critical. A  couple of months ago, I followed an independence referendum organized by an activist movement in Veneto (where I was supposed to go later for the Venice Biennale). Eighty percent of voters voted in favour of independence. Although the federal government immediately declared the referendum unconstitutional, it was a powerful event. In Sardinia, another movement called Cantone Marittimo wants to politically annex Sardinia to Switzerland!

I learned that there is a long history of secessionist actions in Italy. And it’s not the first time that an Italian region has tried to merge with Switzerland.

But the current situation reflects how deeply disillusioned many Italians feel about their national identity.

This is why I launched the following debate: 

A growing number of regional movements want to secede from Italy. The result of the Veneto independence referendum, held earlier this spring, shows the extent to which citizens reject the centralized state, even if it was unofficial. What is the future of Italian unity?

As the debate took place separately in Italian and English, I don’t know if the community split in two groups by language. But the highest-ranked proposals in the English-language debate were put forth by users who also participated in the Italian debate.

The top proposal was made by user _lemur_, who demonstrated the discontent Italians feel about the country’s political establishment:

**Reform at the Top**

_lemur_     nominated 10 minutes ago

The inability for reform at the top causes reform from the bottom. If the state could cut back on the costs of government bureaucracy, it would calm down the exasperated citizens supporting the independence movements.

The proposal received 4 nomination points.

It was followed by a proposal from user _gim_, who was successful in previous discussions. 

**Southern Italy should secede**

_gim_     nominated 2 days ago

The Mediterranean Union movement argues that southern Italy should secede. With the help of the European Union, this area could make advances in scientific research, technology, tourism, art and agriculture. This would give the area an extra push out of its current position of subordination and underdevelopment, forced on the area by the Italian state since the Kingdom of Italy was first established.

Foreigners like myself, having only travelled in southern Italy, may find this proposal paradoxical. Doesn’t the south depend on the north’s economic power? But maybe foreigners have to accept this as one of the paradoxes of Italy. And maybe it is true that the unification process since the nineteenth century has not overcome the deep cultural and social differences between centres like Milan, Turin, or Veneto, on the one hand, and the Mezzogiorno on the other.

But Italy also needs to be seen in the larger context of Europe. This is what our loyal user otto6 did in his proposal:

**Europe is the least denominator**

What kind of unity you are talking about? Seems this is about political economics. In this regard, stronger regions want to be independent and weaker ones call for Europe. Ironically, the EU is the least common denominator of the poor in Europe...

This proposal came in third, after the ones made by lemur and gim. Another user replied that he’d noticed that European flags are more often visible in poorer regions.

I’m not sure if this is true. But during my trip I found that Italy is definitely embracing the European identity despite the economic rollercoaster…
