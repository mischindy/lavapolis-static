It seemed very Monaco-like. A big boat docked in the port, a party fuelled with Champagne, and people raving to Daft Punk. There was this girl. Anoosheh. She was dancing, too, and was obviously having fun. I happened to sit next to her in the crowd. It was pretty noisy but from what I understood, she’s from Monaco. But she didn’t look like it, which I told her. She said she was actually born in Afghanistan and grew up in an orphanage there. A stranger would come to visit her. Again and again. Brought her food and clothes. A teddy that she’s kept until today. One day, the man took her away from the orphanage and smuggled her out of the country. For some reason, he lived in this weird place called Monaco. It turned out that, at the time, it was the only country in Europe where he was allowed to adopt an Afghan girl. Now Anoosheh was on vacation here. She was visiting from her college in the UK, she told me that night on the boat.
