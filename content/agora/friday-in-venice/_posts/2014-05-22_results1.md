This week, Europe will elect a new parliament. But what keeps Europe together in times of turmoil? What does it mean to be a European in a world that is at once globalized and defined by strong regional affiliations? What people think Europe can and can never be differs among nations, the north and the south, political parties and also among families and groups of friends. Last night, I had a look at the Debating Europe page, a platform with the aim of bringing people together to discuss the state of Europe with policymakers. I excerpted some quotes from the online community in an attempt to reflect the conversation being had across Europe and some of the central arguments that weâ€™ve heard over the last few months. But watch for yourself.
