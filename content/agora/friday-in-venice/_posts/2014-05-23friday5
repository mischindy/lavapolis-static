The Netherlands and the UK have already voted. The other European countries are going to follow. On Sunday we will know in which direction Europe is heading. The voices of the online community are diverse: 

What should be the priorities for the next EU? In my opinion, press the “reset” button and start everything again. Practice better the thing they call Europe. Europe is aging! Young Europeans do not have jobs! The one thing crisis provides that is a positive, is a kick in the butt. The Swedes travel, the Croats emigrate. Both sides haven’t made enough to tackle this huge issue. Solutions? Young people tend to be less naïve, and know how misused their vote can be. Can we vote on Facebook/Online, everyday? It’s a better way to communicate, but it’s just not enough when tens of millions are hit by austerity. Just wait. It never was a matter of people. It is always a matter of blood thirsty leader. You had your chance. Now it is our turn.
