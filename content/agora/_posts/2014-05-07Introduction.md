Hi, I belong to a pressure group of artists and web geeks. Most of us come from America and Europe, others from Russia and China—but it doesn’t actually matter where we come from. What matters is that we are now on the island of Lavapolis.

My friends and I had had enough of the world’s pessimism. No one believed in a future anymore. The island where we now live describes itself as a “heterotopia.” A place where things work differently. Where people live differently. Where you feel like you’re part of some kind of social experiment. Nothing is set in stone. You can intervene, get involved. There are rules, but you are allowed to suggest changes to those rules if you feel they’re necessary. 

This is all possible because most of the people living on Lavapolis are originally from elsewhere. They want to create a better society than the one they left. But we don’t assume that we know it all. We like to share, and we like to explore. So we look for new ideas, for solutions to problems. Some of us travel on the internet; some travel to other countries in search for those ideas. This is why I am here: to explore Europe. I believe that there are a lot of new ideas floating around the continent. And they may not only be relevant to you Europeans, but also to us living on the island of Lavapolis. 

So here’s the deal: I am going to share with you the interesting things that I come across during my journey over the coming months. You’ll have your say on it. You may have suggestions. Better views. We’ll try out a social experiment together. It might fail, but it might also help build a better society. Here, in your world, or on our island. Or both. I’ll be right back. Just scroll down, and I’ll share my first thoughts with you.
