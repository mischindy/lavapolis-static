_This video takes a look at an island, which does not (yet) exist._

We are the vanguard. Each vanguard has a common fate: it is either guided by a new truth or led astray by a new error. We will not discover whether the journey has been worthwhile or not. 

_My dear mother gave birth to me in Aluva, Kerala._

The island has both the world’s highest standard of living and the lowest unemployment rate. The education and health systems have a reputation for setting standards; and the ratio of foreigners (almost eighty percent) has not so far caused any cultural tension in public. The current constitution is based on four reliable strategic pillars: populist democracy, universal solidarity, neutrality in foreign policy and the Autonomous Territories Cooperation Arrangement.
They are the pioneers of a social experiment that they have selected for themselves.

This is LED, the Laboratory for Experimental Dynamics. A privileged space mirroring our ideals. . An interphase connecting the multitudes of urban life. Cathartic and cheerful. A contemporary ritual.

The place itself may be unreachable and transient, but it provides opportunities to detach from the apparently apodictic social or economic reality of the present age. 

It is not big money that is turning this small patch of earth into a promised land. But it attracts talented and ambitious people. That is the key. They are people with whom you can establish something. When I say “talented”, I do not just mean experts and high flyers and certainly not millionaires. Even a cleaning lady and a bricklayer can be talented or lack talent. 

_You cannot throw your fingerprints away like a passport. So I cut my fingers myself._

The cities where we live, wherever they are, are testimonies to our naivety and our belief in a better world. They are the laboratories of our self-imposed experiments. 

_I have heard of people who have rediscovered their faith in God here._

Learning from the poorest of the poor means arming ourselves for the future. I really am an experimental dog. But I shot myself into space. It has the potential to reflect the inner world of the international community and its order and be one step ahead of it. Many people say that the island is a paradise. Others say it is a paradise of evil. Both are right and wrong. They are experimenting with measuring time. 

_I am now 103 years old. Some of my friends still come to play dominos. Iosif is actually two years older than I am. Nothing amazes me any longer. We have simply forgotten to die._

The Internet has taught us to think inclusively and bid farewell to the exclusiveness of earlier movements. The Internet has also taught us that inclusiveness should not be confused with the notion of community. Inclusiveness is the process of including yourself, not including others. We are taking action on ourselves before we direct our attention towards society. We are taking action with ourselves and are directing our attention at others in the process. Our deeds set the example for possible actions taken by others. We are calling for involvement, not liberation.
