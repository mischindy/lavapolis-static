Lavapolis is a transmedia storytelling project about a possible society in our time: the island Lavapolis. It unfolds in the book Lavapolis, on this website and in interactive games.

This website assembles voices from residents and  visitors of the island. These reports do not form a total picture. They contradict and also agree with each other. Their authors might be enemies in a different world. But once they land on the island, they become part of a social project. 

We imagine Lavapolis as large as Malta, situated deeper than any other shore in the Mediterranean rift between the coasts of Crete, Sicily, and Libya.The residents’ joint expectation is that society on the island will facilitate ways of living that can constantly be renewed due to this ongoing political, economic, and cultural experiment. This is life simultaneous with the outside world. 

The administration of the island calls this a heterotopia, a counter-site, which reveals the real world but also challenges it. The place itself may be unreachable and transient, but it provides the opportunity to detach from the apodictic social or economic reality of the present age—although this can also happen in the real world too. 

Lavapolis is the report of these instances of detachment.

### Friday in Venice
One of its residents named Friday undertakes a travel to Europe and intiates an online debate game about a possible alternative society. You are invited to follow his travel observations, discuss critical social and political issues with Friday and develop alternative social narratives. Registered users can join the debate, read the opinions of others, and write and support proposals. Users who propose the most popular ideas will win privileges in the game. Read more in “?”.
